          Hey, I'm Eldren, a web developer who can definitely help you
          center that div. No, seriously, it's not as easy as it sounds,
          but don't worry, I got you.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 text-justify">
          I spend my days building websites that don't suck, and my
          nights wondering why "it works on my machine" never works on
          any other machine.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 text-justify">
          I'm the guy who'll turn your design mockups into functional
          websites without crying into my coffee. And I'm not
          just a front end guy—I've got the back end covered too. Whether
          it's setting up servers, working with APIs, or deploying your
          over-engineered todo list app on Kubernetes (if you're into
          that kind of thing), I've got you. I specialize in development
          and deployment.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 text-justify">
          When I'm not coding, you can find me pretending to play
          guitar, skating until my ankle regrets it, or doing my best to
          avoid the never-ending list of things I should learn.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 text-justify">
          If you need a website that's fast, functional, and actually
          works—or if you just want to nerd out over the latest tech
          trends—drop me a message. I promise I won't send you a "hello
          world" website unless you ask for it.
        </p>

          Let's make something amazing—or at least not terrible.
